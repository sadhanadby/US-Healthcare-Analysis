## 📊 Project Overview

As a Data Analyst at a national healthcare oversight organization, I was tasked with analyzing a comprehensive dataset containing medical records from 10 major hospitals across the United States. The data includes patient demographics, diagnoses, medications, insurance coverage, admission details, treatment costs, and more.

The goal of this project was to design an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that uncovers key insights into hospital operations and patient care, enabling data-informed decisions for healthcare stakeholders.
